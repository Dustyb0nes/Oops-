#Here’s a simple example of a Python #script that #uses a basic AI model. This script can be #uploaded to your phone using a terminal. We’ll #use a simple neural network with TensorFlow to #classify handwritten digits from the MNIST #dataset.

env sserver 
#Install TensorFlow:
pip install tensorflow

#Create the Python script:
Python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
import numpy as np

env ;

#Load and preprocess the data
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0 env;

#Build the model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') env
]);

#Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy']);

#Train the model
>env model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5);

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)> env;
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}');

#AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. #More info on FAQ.
#Upload the script to your phone:
#Connect your phone to your computer via USB.
#Enable file transfer mode on your phone.
#Use the terminal to copy the script to your phone. #For example:
cp path/to/your_script.py /path/to/>_env/your/phone/directory/;

#Run the script on your phone:
#Ensure you have a Python environment set up on #your phone. You can use apps like Termux for #Android.
#Navigate to the directory where you uploaded the #script and run it:
#python 
env your_script.py;

#This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand on this by adding more complex models or integrating other AI libraries. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
